# How to Migrate to v5

We highly recommend to update to the latest version of v4, before migrating to v5. It will show all deprecation warnings without breaking your app.

## Changes in v5

- Drop default exports
- Drop deprecated features
- Make React 18 the minimum required version
- Make use-sync-external-store a peer dependency (required for `createWithEqualityFn` and `useStoreWithEqualityFn` in `zustand/traditional`)
- Make TypeScript 4.5 the minimum required version
- Drop UMD/SystemJS support
- Organize entry points in the package.json
- Drop ES5 support
- Other small improvements (technically breaking changes)

## Migration Guide

### `createWithEqulityFn`

The `create` function in v5 does not support customizing equality function.

If you use custom equality function such as `shallow`,
The easiest migration is to use `createWithEqulityFn`.

```js
// v4
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
  // ...
}))

const Component = () => {
  const { count, text } = useCountStore(
    (state) => ({
      count: state.count,
      text: state.text,
    }),
    shallow,
  )
  // ...
}
```

That can be done with `createWithEqulityFn` in v5:

```bash
npm install use-sync-external-store
```

```js
// v5
import { createWithEqualityFn as create } from 'zustand/traditional'

// The rest is the same as v4
```

Alternatively, for the `shallow` use case, you can use `useShallow` hook:

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'
import { useShallow } from 'zustand/shallow'

const useCountStore = create((set) => ({
  count: 0,
  text: 'hello',
  // ...
}))

const Component = () => {
  const { count, text } = useCountStore(
    useShallow((state) => ({
      count: state.count,
      text: state.text,
    })),
  )
  // ...
}
```
